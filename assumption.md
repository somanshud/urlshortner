1. As per the email I recieved the goal is to make url shortening system . So I made the same with the help of Laravel Framework . I have used my custom logic to create unique Short url which u can see in the UI .

2. I make a single table where I keep Shorcode and orgLink generated by the url generator.
3. However There are many packages available in the language but I choose my custom logic over them instaed of sending my data to them rather I keep them in my database which is much secure.
